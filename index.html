                    <div class="over">There's a reason this version of the ship is the star attraction at Disney Parks' Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: Battered or no, it is the star attraction of the Star Wars universe. What it lacks in size (it's a modest 115 feet, or 35 meters long), it makes up in swagger, longevity -- and evasive-maneuvering capability. Though many have tried, Han's modified ride can't be caught. The Falcon isn't just regarded as one of the fastest ships in the Star Wars franchise, but in the entire sci-fi universe.

But what really takes this battle cruiser to the next level is her weaponry: Per the book Star Wars: The Force Awakens -- Incredible Cross-Sections, the Finalizer boasts more than 1,500 turbolasers and ion cannons.</div>

And we can't quibble: This is Darth Vader's TIE fighter, the one he flies into the Death Star's trenches -- and into film history -- in Star Wars: A New Hope.
